Summer School on Full Stack Open-Source Ecosystem for Processor Based Chip Design

UCERD Technology Development Lab (TechPark is a state-of-the-art secure processor and supercomputer based lab to solve Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big-Data applications. The proposed technology lab will give support to final year projects, faculty and industrial problems. The lab provides guidance and resources to solve real-life projects. The technology lab targets following areas:
        ◦ Cluster Developments for Cloud, BareMetal and Data-Center applications. Configuration and Deployment using Kubernetes, OpenStack and OpenHPC cluster development frameworks.
        ◦ Distributed Artificial Intelligence using Distributed Tensorflow, Horovod frameworks.
        ◦ Big-Data Analytics using Spark and Hadoop frameworks.
        ◦ Parallel Application Development using parallel programming approaches on Shared Memory and Distributed Memory Processing Systems.
        ◦ Software development for RISC-V architecture, including performance evaluation, optimization, and profiling for different RISC-V architectures (embedded, RTOS, etc.).
        ◦ Compiler modification and design, as well as optimizing new ALU, memory, and special-purpose instruction sets within the RISC-V op-codes.
        ◦ Configuring and porting Linux to different RISC-V SoC systems.
        ◦ Designing RISC-V processor  architecture and application specific accelerators in Logisim, HDL, and different SOC framework tools.
        ◦ Functional Testing and verification of computer, and system-on-chip architecture.
        ◦ FOSS VLSI Design Tools for Formal Verification & ASIC chip design
